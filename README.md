# Billionaire-proof Your Life
A series of small, collaborative workshops to transition ourselves away from billionaire-building companies toward more democratic alternatives. This repository contains website and workshop materials.

## Guidelines for BPYL Workshops

All events are free to attend, but requests for donations to cover costs directly related to hosting the event (hosting or venue fees, snacks, etc.) may be made. All events must strive to honor the credo No One Turned Away For Lack of Funds (NOTAF) in a sincere and forthright manner.

BPYL doesn't raise money for charities at online or in-person events. No political endorsements given. Proper effort to either avoid or openly declare any conflicts-of-interest must be shown.

Everyone must be told when an event is being recorded. Whenever possible, participants should get access to recordings soon after the event ends and for a reasonable amount of time. These recordings do not belong to the public domain and do not need to be distributed to non-participants.

The de-billionairizing takes collective effort, let's make one another feel welcome and comfortable. Organizers should consider accessibility and the impact of care-taking responsibilities when planning workshops. Participants (including organizers) in BPYL workshops agree to follow the [Contributor's Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/). Strive for a good vibe!
